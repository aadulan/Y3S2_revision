<h4> 1.1 Soloutions of Simultaneuos Linear Equations</h4>

* Solving a system of linear equations -> using an extended coefficient matrix  to find the soloution set.
* Gaussian Elimination -> echelon form without changing the soloution set
  - Row addition 
  - Row swap
    - The idea is that you try to get the coefficient of the first coloum 0 besides 1 of them and you try and carry that on with the rest of the rows.
